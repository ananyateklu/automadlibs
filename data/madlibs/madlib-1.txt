Is that an upvote?\n\nAfter refreshing the page $adjective times, this was a $adjective sight.\n\n\"Wow!\" I say. \" $adjective Steem Dollars (SBD)! $verb you whales!\"\n\nI close my browser tab as I $verb about Steemit.\n\n\"I might not be an anarchist, but at least I\'ve got my posts!\"\n\nFeeling $adjective, I decide to take a break from Steemit, and head into the kitchen to make a cup of $noun.\n\n\"I can\'t believe it happened again! After all the $verb I did when writing my post...\"\n\nWhile $verb my $noun, I began to think.\n\n\"Where did I go $adjective ? I made sure to write about $noun, because that\'s totally $adjective right now. I don\'t really understand it, but everyone on Steemit seems to like $noun. Maybe that\'s why I\'ve been doing so $adjective!?\"\n\nConfused as usual, I decided to go back and $verb my post.\n\n\"What happened?! Just a second ago I had $adjective upvotes, and now I have $adjective?! This website is so $adjective!\"\n\nA few seconds passed before I realized what had happened.\n\n\"Ohhhh, that\'s what happened! It\'s all thanks to $adjective$adjective$noun!\"
